Uno.UI.2048
===========

The classic 2048 recreated in Uno.UI

Still missing a lot though. Stuff I want to add:
- Fancy animations
- (remove) Bug wich causes you unable to move *all* tiles in one move
- Fancy background
- Proper highscore counter (current one is my highscore in real 2048)
- End of game detection and restart functionality
- (remove) Shitload of unkown bugs
- Add tidy code
- ~~Mobile functionality (swiping)~~

Check out the original 2048 [here(NSFW)](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)
